Flickrer
========

A modern and complete [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) PHP wrapper library.

## What's different about this library?

The approach behind this library strives to use the modern PHP ecosystem approach for everything.

The idea is to provide a stable, feature-rich, easy to use, fluent interface for building apps on Flickr
platform using PHP.

The library shall covered by tests and undergo static code analysis testing too. 

## HTTP client abstraction

This library uses [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/) - this means that you can choose any HTTP client 
you wish and avoid the problem of conflicting library versions. Read how it works on 
[HTTPlug for library users](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html) page.
